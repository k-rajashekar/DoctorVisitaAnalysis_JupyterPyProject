# Doctor Visits Analysis Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and data for a comprehensive data analysis project focused on understanding patient behavior and factors influencing doctor visits. The primary objective is to derive valuable insights that can aid healthcare providers, policymakers, and stakeholders in improving patient care and optimizing healthcare services.

## Data
The project utilizes a well-curated dataset named "final_dataset_doctorvisit_excel.xlsx," encompassing patient demographics, gender, age, income, active illnesses, hospital visits, healthcare expenditure, and more. Rigorous data preprocessing ensures data integrity and relevant feature engineering.

## Methodology
The project employs a diverse range of methodologies, including descriptive statistics, data visualization, segmentation analysis, and correlation analysis. Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy are judiciously utilized to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Key Insights
1. **Income and Hospital Visits:** A line chart demonstrates the correlation between income levels and the frequency of hospital visits per month.
2. **Active Illness by Gender:** Pie charts showcase the proportion of reduced workdays due to illness separately for males and females.
3. **Age and Active Illness:** A bar chart presents the percentage of people with active illnesses across different age groups.
4. **Localities with Most Patients:** A bar chart illustrates the distribution of patients across the top 5 localities with the highest caseloads.
5. **Hospital Distance and Visits:** A line chart reveals the relationship between the distance from the nearest hospital and the number of monthly hospital visits.
6. **Seasonal Impact on Illness Cases:** A bar chart highlights the total number of active illness cases in each season.

## Conclusion
The doctor visits analysis provides valuable insights into patient behavior and healthcare trends. Leveraging sophisticated data analysis and visualization techniques, this project offers actionable information for healthcare stakeholders to enhance service quality and patient satisfaction.

## Future Work
The project can be further extended by incorporating additional variables, exploring predictive modeling to forecast trends, and integrating external datasets for more comprehensive analysis.
